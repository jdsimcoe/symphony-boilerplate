## Symphony Overview

Symphony is a `PHP` & `MySQL` based CMS that utilises `XML` and `XSLT` as its core technologies. This repository uses version `2.5.0beta1` and is considered unstable. It also includes a bleeding-edge [Associations Interface](http://www.getsymphony.com/discuss/thread/106489/) implementation.

## Gulp

More coming soon...
