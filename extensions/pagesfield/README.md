# Page Select Box Field

- Version: 1.6.1
- Author: Symphony Team (team@symphony21.com)
- Build Date: 5th July, 2012
- Requirements: Symphony 2.3

## Installation

1. Upload the `pagesfield` folder in this archive to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Field: Page Select Box", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. You can now add the "Page Select Box" field to your sections.

## Sorting

The field sorts the pages according to the sortorder determined in 'Blueprints Â» Pages'. If the sorting isn't correct, it's probably because of the sortorder. To set the sortorder of your pages, edit your config.php-file, set symphony/pages_table_nest_children to yes, and sort the pages manually in your pages screen. When done, you can set symphony/pages_table_nest_children back to no (or keep it on yes, if that is your prefered way of working).
